\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced the concept of an iteratable
oblivious pseudo-random function and presented a construction which is
provably secure in the standard model under the DDH assumption.  We
have fully implemented and evaluated this construction and shown that
it is efficient in practice, comparable to similar protocols.  We have
also presented several applications for $\ioprf$ protocols that
demonstrate their usefulness, particularly in applications where
(two-sided) malicious security is necessary.
