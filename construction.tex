\section{Constructions}
\subsection{$\iprf$ Construction}
Let $\G$ be a group of prime order $p$ where the DDH assumption holds,
and $g$ is a random generator of $\G$.

Initialization: choose a key $K=(\vec{{\alpha}},\vec{\beta})$ by sampling
$\ell$ pairs of random scalars
${\alpha_{i}}\getr\Z_p,{\beta_{i}}\getr\Z_p.$

$\iprf(x_1,\ldots,x_\ell)$: output a vector $\vec{v}$ of length $\ell$ where $v_i = g^{\prod_{j=1}^{i} (\alpha_jx_j+\beta_j(1-x_j))}.$

\todo{Show that this is a PRF, add leftover hash lemma}

\subsection{OT-based $\proto$ Construction}

The $\iprf$ above can be computed as an oblivious PRF between a sender $S$ and a receiver $R$.  In this protocol,
the receiver $R$ has an array of bits $(x_1, \ldots, x_\ell)$ and wishes to compute $\iprf(x_1, \ldots, x_\ell)$ using
the key $K$ possessed by $S$.

Let $\ot(b, y_0, y_1)$ denote a secure 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol between $R$ and $S$ where
$S$ holds $y_0$ and $y_1$, $R$ holds $b\in\{0,1\}$, and $R$ obliviously retrieves $y_b$ from $S$.  The OT-based version of $\proto$ works as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ generates $\ell$ random scalars $r_i\getr\Z_p$
\item For each $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, $R$ and $S$ execute $\ot(x_i, r_i\alpha_i, r_i\beta_i)$ and stores the result as $z_i$
\item $S$ sends to $R$ the vector $\vec{C}$ where $\forall 1 \leq i \leq \ell$, $C_i =  G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j}$
\item $R$ recovers $\iprf$ output vector $v$ by calculating $v_i = C_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j$
\end{itemize}


{\bf Correctness:} \todo{update notation} For all $1 \leq i \leq \ell$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
v_i &= C_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_i \\
&= G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} a_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j \\
&= G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} a_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} (a_jr_j)^{b_j}(a_js_j)^{1-b_j} a_j \\
&= G \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j^{b_j}s_j^{1-b_j}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\todo{Show that this is an OPRF. And show that the iterative evaluation is still secure.}


\section{Difference to structured encryption}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different adversary model
\item Matrix queries and labeled data queries, neighbor queries and adjacency queries on graphs, are trivial.
\item Token length?!
\item the original PRF is mentioned by Naor and Reingold (Section 6.3), but details on how to use OT is mentioned by \url{https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2005/3378_304/3378_304.pdf}.  
\end{itemize}



\ignore{
* Note that our iOPRF can be evaluated ``interactively'',  i.e., the receiver runs OTs adaptively

Motivation:

* One could just replace the PRF in structured encryption (Figure 2 /
Section 5) with an OPRF, but this is not sufficient: the adversary
could ``flip-flop'' inside the graph, but we want that they can only
follow paths.

and https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10042572 and http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p420-sahu.pdf

* Similar as with structured encryption (web graphs, graphs, matrices)

* What about running SQL queries https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/453.pdf

* We also allow for ``controlled disclosure'', e.g., the server
reveals one internal node, the root of some subtree, and the client
can then go on and make queries on that subtree.

** Data provider does not want to reveal whole data set, but only ``subtree''
** Cloud Application does not want to leak details about their techniques
