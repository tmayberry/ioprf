\section{Constructions}
We present new constructions for both $\iprf$ and $\ioprf$.  To ease
readability, we omit an important technicality in the description and
proofs: our $\iprf$ and $\ioprf$ constructions do not output
pseudo-random bit strings of length $\lambda$, but pseudo-random
elements of DDH group $\myG$. Yet, converting elements to bit strings
follows from a standard application of the leftover hash
lemma~\cite{leftover}. As $|p|\geq\lambda$, we have
$|\myG|\ge{}2^\lambda$, and we silently assume in the following that each party implicitly hashes the output of
$\iprf$ and $\ioprf$ using any pairwise independent family of hash
functions.


\subsection{$\iprf$ Construction}
Initialization: choose a key $K=(\vec{{\alpha}},\vec{\beta})$ by sampling
$\ell$ pairs of random scalars
${\alpha_{i}},{\beta_{i}}\getr\Z_p.$
$\iprf(x_1,\ldots,x_\ell)$: output a vector $\vec{v}$ of length $\ell$ where $v_i = g^{\prod_{j=1}^{i} (\alpha_jx_j+\beta_j(1-x_j))}.$

\label{sec:newprf}
\begin{construction}
\label{const:newprf}
Define the function ensemble $F' = \{F'_n\}_{n\in N}$.  For every $n$, a key of a function $F'_n$ is a tuple, $\langle P,Q,g,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}\rangle$, 
where $P$ is an $n$-bit prime, $Q$ a prime divisor of $P-1$, $g$ an element of order $Q$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^*$ and $\vec{\alpha}=\langle 
\alpha_0,\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n \rangle$ and $\vec{\beta}=\langle 
\beta_0,\beta_1, \ldots ,\beta_n \rangle$, uniformly random sequences of $n+1$ elements of $\mathbb{Z}_Q$.  For any $n$-bit input, $x=x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n$, the 
function $f'_{P,Q,g,\vec{a},\vec{b}}$ is defined by:
 $$f'_{P,Q,g,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}(x) = (g^{\alpha_0})^{\prod_{x_i=1}\alpha_i \prod_{x_i=0}\beta_i}$$
 \end{construction}

\todo{Show that this is a delegatable PRF.}

 
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:newprf}

If the DDH-Assumption holds, then for every probabilistic polynomial-time oracle machine $\mathcal{M}$, every constant $\gamma > 0$, and for all byt a finite number of $n$'s

$$| Pr[\mathcal{M}^{f'_{P,Q,g,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}}(P,Q,g)=1] - Pr[\mathcal{M}^{R_{P,Q,g}}(P,Q,g) = 1]| < \frac{1}{n^\gamma} $$

where in the first probability, $f'_{P,Q,g,\vec{a},\vec{\beta}}$ is distributed according to $F'_n$, and in the second probability the distribution of $R_{P,Q,g}$ is uniformly chosen in the set of functions with the domain $\{0,1\}^n$ and range $\langle g\rangle$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove this by reduction, showing that if $\mathcal{M}$ exists that can distinguish between $f'$ and a random function, then we can build $\mathcal{M}'$ that can distinguish between $f$ and a random function.

First, assume that $\mathcal{M}$ exists that can violate the inequality from Theorem \ref{theorem:newprf}.  We create $\mathcal{M'}$ as follows.  First, $\mathcal{M}'$ creates and stores a uniformly random vector $\vec{\beta}$ as in Construction~\ref{const:newprf}.  $\mathcal{M}'$ then runs $\mathcal{M}$ as a subroutine.  Each time $\mathcal{M}$ queries the oracle for an evaluation on input $y$, $\mathcal{M}'$ does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Query his own oracle for $z = f(y)$
\item Calculate $z' = z^{\prod_{y_i = 0} \beta_i}$
\item Returns $z'$ to $\mathcal{M}$
\end{enumerate}

$\mathcal{M}'$ outputs the same as $\mathcal{M}$.  If  $\mathcal{M}'$ is interacting with the function $f$, then the responses he gives to $\mathcal{M}$ will be identical to the real function $f'$, due to him being able to add in the extra $b$ components to the result.  If $\mathcal{M}'$ is interacting with a random function, then the responses he gives will be distributed identically to a random function.  Therefore, if $\mathcal{M}$ has a distinguishing advantage, so will $\mathcal{M}'$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{OT-based $\proto$ Construction}

The $\iprf$ above can be computed as an oblivious PRF between a sender $S$ and a receiver $R$.  In this protocol,
the receiver $R$ has an array of bits $(x_1, \ldots, x_\ell)$ and wishes to compute $\iprf(x_1, \ldots, x_\ell)$ using
the key $K$ possessed by $S$.

Let $\ot(b, y_0, y_1)$ denote a secure 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol between $R$ and $S$ where
$S$ holds $y_0$ and $y_1$, $R$ holds $b\in\{0,1\}$, and $R$ obliviously retrieves $y_b$ from $S$.  The OT-based version of $\proto$ works as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ generates $\ell$ random scalars $r_i\getr\Z_p$
\item For each $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, $R$ and $S$ execute $\ot(x_i, r_i\alpha_i, r_i\beta_i)$ and stores the result as $z_i$
\item $S$ sends to $R$ the vector $\vec{C}$ where $\forall 1 \leq i \leq \ell$, $C_i =  G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j}$
\item $R$ recovers $\iprf$ output vector $v$ by calculating $v_i = C_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j$
\end{itemize}


{\bf Correctness:} \todo{update notation} For all $1 \leq i \leq \ell$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
v_i &= C_i \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_i \\
&= G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} a_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j \\
&= G \cdot \frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} a_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} (a_jr_j)^{b_j}(a_js_j)^{1-b_j} a_j \\
&= G \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j^{b_j}s_j^{1-b_j}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\todo{Show that this is an OPRF. And show that the iterative evaluation is still secure.}
