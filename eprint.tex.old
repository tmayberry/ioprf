  \section{Difference to structured encryption}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different adversary model
\item Matrix queries and labeled data queries, neighbor queries and adjacency queries on graphs, are trivial.
\item Token length?!
\item the original PRF is mentioned by Naor and Reingold (Section 6.3), but details on how to use OT is mentioned by \url{https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2005/3378_304/3378_304.pdf}.  
\end{itemize}
}


\ignore{
* Note that our iOPRF can be evaluated ``interactively'',  i.e., the receiver runs OTs adaptively

Motivation:

* One could just replace the PRF in structured encryption (Figure 2 /
Section 5) with an OPRF, but this is not sufficient: the adversary
could ``flip-flop'' inside the graph, but we want that they can only
follow paths.


Apps:
* Graphs: https://robobees.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/grecs.pdf
and https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10042572 and http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p420-sahu.pdf

* Similar as with structured encryption (web graphs, graphs, matrices)

* What about running SQL queries https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/453.pdf

* We also allow for ``controlled disclosure'', e.g., the server
reveals one internal node, the root of some subtree, and the client
can then go on and make queries on that subtree.

Jump and crawl algorithms for analyzing social networks

* Microsoft Azure Marketplace: allow a cloud application to analyze your data.
** Data provider does not want to reveal whole data set, but only ``subtree''
** Cloud Application does not want to leak details about their techniques 
*** Compromise between no security and fully-homomorphic encryption or MPC

* HITS and PageRank: algorithms to analyze properties of an intranet, local sub-tree of the intranet
