\section{Introduction}
Structured encryption allows a data owner to encrypt structured data,
e.g., an XML-document or a tree, and outsource it to an untrusted
server.  They crucial property of structured encryption is that the
data owner can later compute a token which permits the server to
decrypt and parse some well defined part of the data structure, e.g.,
certain elements of the XML-document or a path of the
tree. Computation of tokens is possible despite the owner retaining
only a constant-sized key.

In this paper, we introduce a twist to the standard setting of
structured encryption. Another party, the client, can ask the data
owner to prepare a token to decrypt a specific part of the owner's
data structure. Yet, data owner and client are mutually
untrusted. That is, the client does not want to reveal which part of
the data structure the client is interested in, e.g., which path in
the tree, and the owner wants to prepare a decryption token which
confines the client to accessing only one part of the data
structure. Using the token, the client then fetches the part of the
data structure they are interested in from the server and decrypt
it. In case the client does not trust the server, the client reverts
to standard techniques such as PIR to fetch data from the server. We
will see later that the new setting of structured encryption with an
untrusted client has several interesting real-world applications.

Yet, enabling this added functionality turns out to be technically
challenging. The client parses the owner's data structure in an
iterative fashion, where they can query to decrypt the next item from
the owner's data structure after receiving the previous item.  For
example, after decrypting one node of a binary tree, the client should
be able to query for decryption of either the left or right child
depending on the current node's data content.  At the same time, the
data owner wants to ensure that the client's next node is linked to
the current node, and the client cannot arbitrarily ``jump around'' in
the data structure.

Straightforward, intuitive approaches, where data
is encrypted using, for example, an Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function
(OPRF), fail as...
