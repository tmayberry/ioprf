\section{Construction~\ref{const:ioprf}: DH-based $\ioprf$}
\label{our-ioprf}
We now present a new $\proto$ protocol which realizes the ideal $\ioprf$
functionality $\fioprf$ from Figure~\ref{idealioprf}.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
%\subsubsection{Preliminaries}
Let there be two generators
$g_1,g_2$ of prime order $p$ group $\myG$ where the DDH assumption
holds. Neither party should know the discrete log of one generator
$g_i$ to the basis of the other generator $g_{j\neq{}i}$, which is
true with high probability if they are chosen at random.
%\fk{I just want to note that in a prime-order group, if the discrete logarithm $\log_{g_1}(g_2)$ is known, then so is $\log_{g_2}(g_1)$.}

\paragraph{Elgamal Encryption}
We will use additive Elgamal encryption with private keys $sk\in\Z_p$
and public keys $pk=g_1^{sk}$. Ciphertext $c$ to encrypt $m\in\Z_p$ is
$c=(c[0],c[1])=(g_1^r,pk^r\cdot{}g_2^m)\leftarrow\enc_{pk}(m)$, where
$r\getr\Z_p$.

\paragraph{Pedersen Commitments}
A Pedersen commitment $\com(m)\in\myG$ to message $m\in\Z_p$ is
defined as $\com(m)=g_1^r\cdot{}g_2^m$, where $r\getr\Z_p$.  To open
$\com(m)$, reveal tuple $(m,r)$. Pedersen commitments are perfectly
hiding and computationally binding.

\subsection{High-Level Intuition}
In round $i$ of $\ell$ rounds, sender $S$ will receive
two ciphertexts $V_i$ and $D_i$ from receiver $R$.  During the course of the
protocol, one of these ciphertexts will contain the $\ioprf$ output and one acts
as a ``dummy'', to keep $S$ from learning input bits $x_i$ of $R$.  They are
interchanged between rounds depending on the input bits.

For each round, using the $i^{\text{th}}$ round's keys $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$, $S$
will then ``apply'' $\alpha_i$ to $V_i$ and $\beta_i$ to $D_i$, and send the
results back to $R$. In preparation for the next round $(i+1)$, if $x_{i+1}\neq
x_{i}$, $R$ will swap $V_i$ and $D_i$ for the next round.  After $\ell$ rounds,
$V_\ell$ will have the keys applied which correspond to the input bits of $R$, and
$D_\ell$ will have the complementary combination of keys applied.  $V_0$ is initialized
as an encryption of 1, so $V_\ell$ will contain the correct $\ioprf$ output, whereas
$D_0$ is initialized as an encryption of 0 so it will not contain any information.

\subsection{Technical Details}
For some input string $x=(x_1\ldots{}x_\ell)$, we define the output of
$\proto$ for the receiver as $(v_1,\ldots,v_\ell)=\ioprf_{K}(x)$ with
$v_i=g_2^{\prod_{j=1}^{i}(\alpha_j{}x_j+\beta_j(1-x_j))}$ and $K=\{(\alpha_i,\beta_i)\}^\ell_{i=1}$. 
We now describe details of Construction~\ref{const:ioprf} by its formal
$\proto$ interface (Definition~\ref{def:ioprf}), i.e., first its
initialization and then its iterative processing.

\subsubsection{$\proto$ Initialization}
Sender $S$ randomly chooses secret key
$K=((\alpha_1,\beta_1),\ldots,(\alpha_\ell,\beta_\ell)),
(\alpha_i,\beta_i)\getr(\Z_p)^2$.

$S$ also commits to $K$ by computing $2\ell$ Pedersen commitments
  $(\com(\alpha_i),\com(\beta_i))$. $S$ sends them to $R$ and
  proves knowledge of plaintexts in ZK (see \S\ref{pokop}).

Receiver $R$ computes a random
Elgamal private key $sk\getr\Z_p$ and public key $pk=g_1^{sk}$, and
sends $pk$ to $S$. Receiver $R$ proves knowledge of $sk$ using
a standard Schnorr ZK proof of knowledge (see \S\ref{poe}).


Receiver $R$ computes $V_0 \leftarrow\enc_{pk}(1)$ and
$D_0\leftarrow\enc_{pk}(0)$, sends them to $S$ and proves that
these are encryptions of $1$ and $0$ (see \S\ref{poe} below). 

\subsubsection{$\proto$ Iterative Processing in $\ell$ Rounds}
In round $i\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$, for $S$' input bit $x_i$:
\begin{enumerate}
  
\item {\bf Receiver shuffles:}
\begin{enumerate}%[leftmargin=0.3cm]
\item For input bit $x_i$, $R$ computes Pedersen commitment
  $\com{}(x_i)$ and proves that $x_i\in\{0,1\}$ (see
  \S\ref{pobit}). Similarly, $R$ computes $\com{}(1-x_i)$
  and proves that $(1-x_i)\in\{0,1\}$ (see \S\ref{pobit}). Finally,
  $R$ proves that the sum of plaintexts behind
  $\com{}(x_i)$ and $\com{}(1-x_i)$ equals $1$ (see
  \S\ref{pkseo}).


\item  Receiver $R$ chooses $r,r',r'',r'''\getr\Z_p$ and computes Elgamal ciphertexts
  \begin{align*}
    c_i&=(g_1^r\cdot{}V_{i-1}[0]^{x_i},pk^{r}\cdot{}V_{i-1}[1]^{x_i})
    \\c'_i&=(g_1^{r'}\cdot{}V_{i-1}[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'}\cdot{}V_{i-1}[1]^{1-x_i})
    \\d_i&=(g_1^{r''}\cdot{}D_{i-1}[0]^{x_i},pk^{r''}\cdot{}D_{i-1}[1]^{x_i})
    \\d'_i&=(g_1^{r'''}\cdot{}D_{i-1}[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'''}\cdot{}D_{i-1}[1]^{1-x_i})
 \end{align*}

        }%ignore
  and sends $(c_i,c'_i,d_i,d'_i)$ to $S$.
\item Receiver $R$ proves correctness of the above computations in
  ZK. Specifically, $(c_i,c'_i,d_i,d'_i)$ result from correct
  exponentiation with $x_i$ (or $1-x_i$) from $\com{}(x_i)$ (or
  $\com{}(1-x_i)$), and multiplication with a random power of
  $g_1$ and $pk$, i.e., re-randomization (homomorphic addition of
  encryption of $0$).  See \S\ref{pexr} below for details.
   Both parties compute
\begin{align*}
   T_i&=(c_i[0]\cdot{}d'_i[0],c_i[1]\cdot{}d'_i[1])
    \\U_i&=(c'_i[0]\cdot{}d_i[0],c'_i[1]\cdot{}d_i[1]).
\end{align*}   
  \end{enumerate}
In the first round, after this step, $T_1$ is an encryption of $1$ and $U_1$ is an encryption of $0$ if $x_1 = 1$.
If $x_1 = 0$, then $T_1$ is an encryption of $0$ and $U_1$ is an encryption of $1$.
However,  sender $S$ does not know which of the two is the case.

\item {\bf Sender computes PRF:} For $r,r'\getr\Z_p$, $S$ computes the two Elgamal ciphertexts
  \begin{align*}
    X_i&=(g^r_1\cdot{}T_i[0]^{\alpha_i},pk^r\cdot{}T_i[1]^{\alpha_i})
    \\Y_i&=(g^{r'}_1\cdot{}U_i[0]^{\beta_i},pk^{r'}\cdot{}U_i[1]^{\beta_i}),
    \end{align*}
  sends $(X_i,Y_i)$ to $R$, and proves correct exponentiation
  (scalar multiplication of plaintexts) with $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$
  coming from previous commitments $\com{}(\alpha_i),\com{}(\beta_i)$
  \emph{and} re-randomization of ciphertexts (see \S\ref{pexr}).

\item {\bf Receiver shuffles back:}
  For $r,r',r'',r'''\getr\Z_p$, $R$ computes%\vskip 2eX
  \begin{align*}
    P_i&=(g_1^r\cdot{}X_i[0]^{x_i},pk^r\cdot{}X_i[1]^{x_i})
    \\P'_i&=(g_1^{r'}\cdot{}X_i[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'}\cdot{}X_i[1]^{1-x_i})
   \\Q_i&=(g_1^{r''}\cdot{}Y_i[0]^{x_i},pk^{r''}\cdot{}Y_i[1]^{x_i})
   \\Q'_i&=(g_1^{r'''}\cdot{}Y_i[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'''}\cdot{}Y_i[1]^{1-x_i})
\end{align*}
   \ignore{
     \begin{centering}
    \begin{tabular}{l@{\hskip 0.5cm}l}
    $P_i=(g_1^r\cdot{}X_i[0]^{x_i},pk^r\cdot{}X_i[1]^{x_i})$
    &$P'_i=(g_1^{r'}\cdot{}X_i[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'}\cdot{}X_i[1]^{1-x_i})$
   \\$Q_i=(g_1^{r''}\cdot{}Y_i[0]^{x_i},pk^{r''}\cdot{}Y_i[1]^{x_i})$
   &$Q'_i=(g_1^{r'''}\cdot{}Y_i[0]^{1-x_i},pk^{r'''}\cdot{}Y_i[1]^{1-x_i})$

  }%ignore
  and sends $(P_i,P'_i,Q_i,Q'_i)$ together with ZK proofs of correct
  computation (see \S\ref{pexr}) to $S$.

  Both $S$ and $R$ compute
  $V_i=(P_i[0]\cdot{}Q'_i[0],P_i[1]\cdot{}Q'_i[1])$ and
  $D_i=(P'_i[0]\cdot{}Q_i[0],P'_i[1]\cdot{}Q_i[1])$.
  
In round $i$, after this step, $V_i$ is an encryption of $\iprf_{K}(x_1,\ldots,x_i)$, and $U_i$ is an encryption of $0$.
When computing $T_{i+1}$ and $U_{i+1}$, these values will be used instead of the encryptions of $0$ and $1$ and the iterative computation of the PRF continues.
Since both parties compute $V_i$ and $U_i$, $R$ cannot cheat and substitute for a value of his choice.

\item Receiver $R$ computes and outputs one $\iprf$ value
  $v_i=\frac{V_i[1]}{V_{i}[0]^{sk}}$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Discussion}
Observe that, in the last step, $R$ can never decrypt
additively homomorphic Elgamal ciphertext $(V_i[0],V_i[1])$ and thus
compute an $\alpha_i$ or $\beta_i$. As $\alpha_i$ or $\beta_i$ are in
the exponent and due to the hardness DLOG, $R$ can only
compute $v_i=g_2^{\ldots\alpha_i\ldots}$ or
$v_i=g_2^{\ldots\beta_i\ldots}$.
If $R$ wants to run several execution of
Construction~\ref{const:ioprf} and wants that $S$ uses the same key,
then $R$ will verify that commitments sent by $S$ during initialization do not change between executions. This
leads to {verifiability}.
Also note that communication complexity and computational complexity
are both in $O(\ell)$ per query, i.e.,  asymptotically
optimal.
