\subsection{Warm-up: simple $\ioprf$ with One-Sided Security}
\label{sec:ot-ioprf}
Our $\iprf$ from Construction~\ref{const:newprf} can be computed as an
$\ioprf$ with only one-sided security, i.e., malicious receiver or
semi-honest (or malicious, but only focusing on violating
privacy~\cite{one-sided}) sender, using a similar approach as the OPRF
by \citeauthor{oprf} (Construction~\ref{ot-oprf}).  Let
$\ot(b, y_0, y_1)$ denote any $\binom{2}{1}$ oblivious transfer
protocol which is one-sided simulatable~\cite{one-sided} or even
maliciously secure~\cite{schneiderot,schollot}.  Sender $S$ holds
$y_0$ and $y_1$ from $\Z_p$, receiver $R$ holds $b\in\{0,1\}$, and $R$
obliviously retrieves $y_b$ from $S$. Let $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_\ell)$ be
$R$'s input.  Our first OT-based construction for a $\proto$ protocol
gives an $\ioprf$ with one-sided security and works as follows.

\begin{construction}[One-Sided Secure $\ioprf$]
\label{const:one-side}
  \begin{itemize}
\item $S$ generates $\ell$ random scalars $r_i\getr\Z_p$.
\item For each $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, $R$ and $S$ execute $\ot(x_i, r_i\beta_i,r_i\alpha_i)$,  $R$ stores the result as $z_i$.
\item $S$ sends to $R$ the sequence $C=(C_1,\ldots,C_\ell)$ where
  $C_i = g^\frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j}.$
\item $R$ recovers $\iprf$ output sequence $(v_1,\ldots,v_\ell)$ by calculating $v_i
  = C_i^{\prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j}.$
\end{itemize}
\end{construction}

{\bf Correctness:}  For all $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
v_i &= C_i^{\prod_{j=1}^{i} z_i} 
= g^{\frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} z_j} 
= g^{\frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^{i} r_j} \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{i} (\alpha_jr_j)^{x_j}(\beta_jr_j)^{1-x_j} } 
\\&= g^{\prod_{j=1}^{i} \alpha_j^{x_i}\beta_j^{1-x_i}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


To prove security for Construction~\ref{const:one-side}, we could make
a similar argument as \citet{oprf}, but rely on a one-sided
simulatable OT. However, we refrain from presenting more details, as
this $\ioprf$ anyways provides only one-sided security and conversion
to malicious security would be difficult. One would need to prove
correct computation of the $C_i$ and expensive maliciously secure OT
with ZK proofs that the sender's input $(r_i\beta_i,r_i\alpha_i)$
matches previous commitments to $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$. This is very
different from standard committed or verifiable
OT~\cite{commit-ot,verifot,commit-ot2}.
