\subsubsection{Delegation}
As $\ioprf$s are delegatable, we also support scenarios where a main
database delegates the information to identify tags of, e.g.,
different countries or regions to different sub-databases.  We abstain
from presenting lengthy details, but delegation~\cite{sherman2}
with $\ioprf$s would bring the advantage that if keys from one
regional sub-database are stolen and thus tags in that region can be
fabricated, tags and their identification in other sub-databases are
still secure.
